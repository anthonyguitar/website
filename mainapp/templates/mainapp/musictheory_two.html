                            There are 12 notes and two ways to represent
                            them.
                            <br><br>
                            The 12 notes represented with sharps (# symbol) look like this:
                            <br><br>
                            A, A&#9839;, B, C, C&#9839;, D, D&#9839;, E, F, F&#9839;, G, G&#9839;
                            <br><br>
                            The 12 notes represented with flats (b symbol) look like this:
                            <br><br>
                            A, B&#9837;, B, C, D&#9837;, D, E&#9837;, E, F, G&#9837;, G, A&#9837;
                            <br><br>
                            Basically you have the alphabet A through G
                            with a sharp (or flat) in-between each letter
                            EXCEPT between B &amp; C and between E &amp; F.
                            <br><br>
                            As a beginner songwriter, you'll only care
                            about 7 notes at a time. Which 7 should we care
                            about? Let's start by picking a key, which is
                            just a collection of 7 of the 12 notes that the
                            some people somewhere determined sound good
                            together. One of the keys to become familiar
                            with on guitar is G Major, because most of the
                            open chords (cowboy chords) used by songwriters
                            are in the key of G Major. Don't get hung up on
                            which key to pick, just pick one and start
                            writing.
                            <br><br>
                            G Major has these 7 notes, and when played
                            sequentially are called the G Major scale.
                            <br><br>
                            G, A, B, C, D, E, and F&#9839;
                            <br><br>
                            We can assign a number to each note and use
                            that number representation to make our lives
                            much easier down the road. Let's assign the
                            numbers to our notes like this (because why
                            not?)
                            <br><br>
                            G (1), A (2), B (3), C (4), D (5), E (6), and F&#9839; (7)
                            <br><br>
                            These will be the notes you can use to create melodies and chords for your very first song.
                            <br><br>
                            Great we know which notes to play while we are
                            in G Major. Last time I checked, songs normally
                            have chords (multiple notes played
                            simultaneously). What chords can we play in the
                            key of G Major?
                            <br><br>
                            Each key has 7 basic chords you can play, one
                            for each root note in the key. Each chord is
                            formed by taking a root note (the lowest note
                            of the chord) and then stacking two more notes
                            on top (the 3rd note and the 5th note).
                            <br><br>
                            Woah slow down, what is this 3rd and 5th lingo?
                            The 3rd is simply two notes away from the root
                            note, and the 5th is two notes away from the
                            3rd (or five away from the root). Remember how
                            we numbered the 7 notes in G major? Well to
                            form a G Major chord, just take G as your root
                            note (the 1), then take B as your next note
                            (the 3), and then take D as your last note (the
                            5). The hip cats call it 1,3,5.
                            <br><br>
                            So now you know how to construct a G major
                            chord by starting with the 7 note G major
                            scale. Wait a minute, no interesting songs ever
                            consisted of just one chord. Let's learn how to
                            form all 7 available chords using just one
                            simple technique.
                            <br><br>
                            If we start with a different root note, say A,
                            and then reset our scale numbering so that A is
                            our new 1 note, we can form an A chord by
                            taking the new notes represented by 1st, 3rd,
                            and 5th notes.
                            <br><br>
                            Please don't get overwhelmed. Just take the G
                            major scale with our original numbering scheme.
                            <br><br>
                            G (1), A (2), B (3), C (4), D (5), E (6), and
                            F&#9839; (7)
                            <br><br>
                            and shift all of the numbers to the right by
                            one to while keeping the letters fixed like
                            this (the last number (7) wraps around to the
                            front and gets assigned to the G.
                            <br><br>
                            G (7), A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), E (5), and
                            F&#9839; (6)
                            <br><br>
                            Now the 1, 3, and 5 represents an A chord.
                            <br><br>
                            Well it turns out you can follow this same
                            procedure to figure out the proper notes to
                            that form all 7 chords within the G major key.
                            Here they are.
                            <br><br>
                            G chord: G B D<br>
                            A chord: A C E<br>
                            B chord: B D F&#9839;<br>
                            C chord: C E G<br>
                            D chord: D F&#9839; A<br>
                            E chord: E G B<br>
                            F# chord: F&#9839; A C
                            <br><br>
                            Great. But what do they sound like? There are
                            two main flavors and one weird flavor of chords
                            here. You have 3 major chords, 3 minor chords,
                            and 1 diminished chord (we will worry about
                            this later). Major chords usually sound happy
                            and minor chord usually sound sad (with
                            infinitely many exceptions).
                            <br><br>
                            What makes a chord major or minor is the
                            distance between the root note and the third
                            note. For example, the G chord in the G major
                            key is major because the 3rd note in its chord
                            is B, which is 4 half-steps away from G. This
                            distance has a name (major 3rd interval)
                            because it gives the chord its happy or sad
                            sound quality.
                            <br><br>
                            In contrast, an A chord in the key of G major
                            is a minor chord. The distance between its root
                            note (A) and it's third note (C) is only 3
                            half-steps away rather than 4. This interval
                            also has a name (minor 3rd interval), because
                            it gives the chord a minor sound.
                            <br><br>
                            I'll go ahead and tell you the flavors of each
                            chord within G major.
                            <br><br>
                            G Major chord: G B D<br>
                            A Minor chord: A C E<br>
                            B Minor chord: B D F&#9839;<br>
                            C Major chord: C E G<br>
                            D Major chord: D F&#9839; A<br>
                            E Minor chord: E G B<br>
                            F# Diminished chord: F&#9839; A C
                            <br><br>
                            I will represent these chords with yet another
                            numbering system (this time Roman numerals) as
                            I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii(dim) so that we can
                            write chord progressions down with just roman
                            numerals instead of notes.
                            <br><br>
                            With this knowledge I invite you to pick 4
                            chords from the chart above and create a
                            progression out of them. Simply put, play one
                            chord for a few strums, then a different chord,
                            etc... Try to listen and find interesting
                            combinations.
                            <br><br>
                            There are a few chord progressions that are
                            very very popular.
                            <br><br>
                            ii, vi, IV, I<br>
                            I, IV, V
                            <br><br>
                            Next lesson we will take a simple chord
                            progression and figure out how to write a
                            melody on top of it!
